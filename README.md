RAG Evaluation Script
This repository contains a Python script designed to perform a basic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) evaluation. The script retrieves relevant documents based on input queries and evaluates the performance of the RAG model. This README will guide you through the setup, usage, and description of each part of the script.

Overview
RAG models combine retrieval mechanisms with generation-based models to enhance performance by incorporating relevant context from external sources. This script:

Accepts a query and retrieves relevant documents.
Evaluates the retrieval and generation quality based on predefined metrics.
Outputs results, including evaluation scores and relevant logs.
Features
Document Retrieval: Retrieves documents based on similarity to the input query.
Evaluation Metrics: Supports multiple types of RAG evaluation and logs results.
Logging: Provides detailed logging of the evaluation process and results.
Requirements
Ensure the following packages are installed:

numpy
datasets
Any other packages listed in requirements.txt
To install dependencies, run:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Setup
Clone this repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-directory>
Install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Load Your Dataset: Ensure that your dataset is in the correct format and can be accessed through the datasets library.
Run the Evaluation Script:
bash
Copy code
python rag_evaluation.py
Script Parameters
query: The input query for which relevant documents will be retrieved.
index: The retrieval index used to find relevant documents.
dataset: The dataset containing the documents.
retriever: The retrieval model used to find similar documents.
Example Code
The main script file, rag_evaluation.py, may look like this:

python
# Sample code snippet

# Define the query
query = "..."

# Perform RAG evaluation
results = rag_evaluation(query, dataset)

# Output results
print(results)
Evaluation
The script performs a basic RAG evaluation and supports different types of RAG evaluation methods. The evaluation includes:

Type of Evaluation: Basic RAG evaluation.
Logger Output: Logs retrieval and generation results for easy debugging and assessment.
